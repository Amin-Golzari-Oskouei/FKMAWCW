# FKMAWCW: Categorical Fuzzy k-Modes Clustering with Automated Attribute-weight and Cluster-weight Learning

The Source_Code file includes the MATLAB implementation of the FWCWFKM algorithm as described in:

A.Golzari oskouei, M.Balafari, C.Motamed "FKMAWCW: Categorical Fuzzy k-Modes Clustering with Automated Attribute-weight and Cluster-weight Learning", Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 2021.

Comments are written for all steps of the algorithm to better understand the code. Also, a demo is implemented for ease of running, which is running by importing data and other necessary algorithm parameters.
