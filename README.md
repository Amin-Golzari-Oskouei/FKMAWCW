# FKMAWCW: Categorical Fuzzy k-Modes Clustering with Automated Attribute-weight and Cluster-weight Learning

The Source_Code file includes the MATLAB implementation of the FWCWFKM algorithm as described in:

A.Golzari oskouei, M.Balafar, and M.Feizi Derakhshi "Categorical Fuzzy k-Modes Clustering with Automated Attribute-weight and Cluster-weight Learning", Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 2021 (submitted).

Comments are written for all steps of the algorithm to better understand the code. Also, a demo is implemented for ease of running, which is running by importing data and other necessary algorithm parameters.

To evaluate the proposed algorithm’s performance, we use the benchmark datasets. There are some datasets in the uploaded file (Dataset.rar).
